A few things I might need help with:

- **Testing**: More test use-cases. Currently, they cover the barest minimum and not enough to test anything realistically. Contributions in this regard would very much be appreciated.
- **Critical Feedback**: Most important one ðŸ˜„, critical feedback. Could range from code colocation, to my apprach to fetching and caching, to the documentation itself. I'm open to all feedback. Thank you!

### Contributing Opportunities

If you are unsure of where to start, here are a few stuffs that would be nice to have:

- **Improved Typing**: The typing for the app is quite good, however there are a few `any` types sprinkled here and there that could be improved upon.
- **More mock docs**: More docs can't hurt, right? ðŸ˜„
- **Improved Documentation**: I don't mean the code itself, I mean this docs you are reading right now. It could be more explanatory, more detailed, more concise, etc. Any improvement would be appreciated. Even typos!
- **Github Actions**: Currently, only github actions regarding syncing the docs to their respective repositories are available. It would be nice to have more actions, such as testing, linting, and especially deployments.
